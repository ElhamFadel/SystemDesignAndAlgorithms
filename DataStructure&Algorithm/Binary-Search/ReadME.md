### Binary Search 
it's two Approach 
 1- Linear Search Approach.
 2- Binary Search Approach(Searching Algorithm).
#### Linear Search Approach 
time complexity of Linear Approach is ```O(n)```
this's simple Approach to binary search 
#### Binary Search Approach 
or called ```Searching Algorithm```

the purpose from it is To reduce time complexity to ```O(Log n)```
Important Note :
 the array should be sorted before apply algorithm
